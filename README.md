#### What
Interactive WebGL + Three.js application with procedurally generated objects.  

Coursework for course [TNM084 Procedural Methods for Images](http://staffwww.itn.liu.se/~stegu76/TNM084-2016/) at Link√∂ping University

#### Run and Develop
Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
```bash
yarn  
  
# hot reloading dev server on port 1337
yarn start
  
# minified build, load in browser however you want
yarn build
```

Or just do `npm install` and `npm start` because it's probably fine
